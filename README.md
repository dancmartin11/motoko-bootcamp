## Day 2 Exercise

- **Description**: Create a canister in Motoko. The canister must have two methods: comments outside the Actor with the following data: Name, Country, and Experience. The `setName` (update) method should receive a name and store it in a variable, while the `getName` (query) method should return the name.


## Day 3 Exercise

- **Description**: Create a canister in Motoko that contains a public method called `sumFibonacci`. This method should receive a natural number `n` as a parameter and return the sum of the Fibonacci sequence up to the `n`-th term. The input will be the number `n`, and the output will be the total sum of the corresponding Fibonacci numbers. Additionally, the result must be an even number; if the sum is not even, the method should add the next term of the Fibonacci sequence until the result is even.
